Fifth Assignment for IT And computers class in Ariel University

This assignment is from SEEDs lab #1 and this assignment makes us familiar with great yet very dangerous tools, in this assignment we learn to:

- Sniffing Packets with or without filters as well as using scapy in python with the BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) syntax or pcap library in C.
- Spoof packets using scapy or socket programming with pcap in C.
- Traceroute using ttl method (python only with scapy).
- Sniff and than spoof - a demonstration where there is an attacker machine, client machine and the target where target machine should give unconditionally ICMP response.
- The target machine should replay wheter it is on or off. 
This implementation is provided in C and python as well.
